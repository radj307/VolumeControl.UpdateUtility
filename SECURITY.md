# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only supported version is the most recent version, including pre-releases.  
Due to the size of the project I don't release post-build patches in any form other than through a new version number.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report vulnerabilities on this repository either in the form of an [issue](https://github.com/radj307/VolumeControl.UpdateUtility/issues/new), or a [pull request](https://github.com/radj307/VolumeControl.UpdateUtility/compare).
